## Overview
A heart disease prediction machine learning project is a machine learning initiative designed to predict heart disease risk by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 13 medical attributes. These attributes include demographic, physiological, and clinical data points that are critical in assessing cardiovascular health.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of medical datasets to identify crucial patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilization of advanced machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- **Health Indicator Insights**: Detailed examination of individual health metrics and their impact on heart health.

## Dataset
Our model is trained on a dataset comprising the following columns:
1. **Age**: The age of the individual.
2. **Sex**: Biological sex (male/female).
3. **Chest Pain Type**: Categorized into 4 distinct types.
4. **Resting Blood Pressure**: The blood pressure readings at rest.
5. **Serum Cholesterol**: Measured in mg/dl.
6. **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Indicates if fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl.
7. **Resting Electrocardiographic Results**: Values of 0, 1, or 2.
8. **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved**: Peak heart rate during exercise.
9. **Exercise Induced Angina**: Presence or absence of chest pain during exercise.
10. **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment**: The slope of the ST segment during peak exercise.
12. **Number of Major Vessels**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13. **Thal**: Thalassemia effect with values indicating normal (3), fixed defect (6), or reversible defect (7).
